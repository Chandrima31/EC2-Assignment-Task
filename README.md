### Parsing a Complex JSON File


• "ubo1.json" file is a complex JSON file having multiple nesting.

• PySpark is used for efficiently reading the JSON file.

• A dataframe is created to store nested JSON content in tabular format. Both ArrayType and StructType are used to explode and flatten columns respectively. 

• The dataframe was printed to check its tabular format. "Full Nested Table Fomat.pdf" gives a fully parsed view of the tabular format. This is to cross check the results derived from code.
